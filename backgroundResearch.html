        Magnetic fields are an interesting phenomenon. They are the movement of
        electrically charged particles in a plane, or the movement of
        electromagnetic force. Particles have specific electrostatic properties
        when they interact in specific ways with things known as virtual
        photons. Virtual photons are basically functions that explain
        fluctuations in the electromagnetic field, fluctuations that give
        particles their charge, based on how they interact with one another. It
        is well known that these particles exert force on one another, if they
        did not all particles would move in a straight line. A magnetic field is
        simply the vectors created from an electric current (i.e moving electric
        force, moving charges). These vectors, or the magnetic field lines, show
        the directions that particles would move if they were to get close to
        the object emitting them. All things have magnetic fields, but electrons
        oriented in different directions cancels out the effective magnetic
        field. However, when this does not happen, then a magnet is created.

        All the bodies in the solar system have magnetic fields, however, some
        are more prevalent… and more interesting than others. Jupiter is the
        largest planet in our solar system. A huge gas giant, Jupiter is
        composed of mostly hydrogen and helium, starting out as gas in the outer
        atmosphere, but condensing down to highly conductive liquid hydrogen,
        swirling down at the planet’s center. It is this sea of electrically
        conductive hydrogen that gives Jupiter the strongest magnetosphere in
        the entire solar system, spanning miles. If we could see Jupiter’s
        magnetosphere from earth, it would extend larger than the moon across
        our sky. The nature of Jupiter’s magnetosphere creates a plasma full of
        charged particles: protons, electrons, and other particles that create a
        plasma around the planet. This plasma rotates with the planet, and the
        conductivity of each particle in the plasma helps strip charged
        particles off the surface of Jupiter’s many moons, adding them to the
        electric current and magnetic field made around the planet.

        Radio emissions from Jupiter have helped scientists understand the
        rotation of the planet, because whether or not you can hear Jupiter
        depends on what part of it is facing you, the Jovian longitude. There
        are specific spots along Jupiter’s rotation that send out intense radio
        waves. These spots do not seem to follow cloud patterns, but rather the
        magnetic fields themselves. A stronger portion of the magnetic field
        means electrons and protons accelerate more, and release a higher
        frequency of electromagnetic radiation, this allows astronomers to find
        the strength of the magnetic field on Jupiter.

        One of Jupiter’s closest moons, Io is integral for the examination of
        electromagnetism of Jupiter. Io is a moon caught in a larger game of
        tug-of-war with Jupiter’s other surrounding moons, and the intense pull
        of the gas giant itself. These combating forces make the moon very
        volcanic. Within its volcanic activity, Io will spit electrons and other
        particles into the plasma of Jupiter’s magnetosphere. These electrons
        and ions are violently accelerated along the vectors of Jupiter’s
        intense magnetic field. This erratic movement causes the emission of
        radio waves, due to the discrepancies in the fields created by so many
        charged particles moving around in different directions.

        These radio waves, constantly propagating from the planet, can be
        detected from the Earth. Detection of these radio waves can further tell
        one about the nature of Jupiter’s magnetic field, the precise location
        of Jovian storms, locations in Jupiter’s orbit where Io storms are most
        detectable from Earth. Using Central Meridian Longitude Charts (CML) can
        help observers of all skill levels observe Io storms for themselves.
        There are areas along Jupiter’s orbit, where storms on Io are most
        probable, due to the nature of Jupiter’s magnetic field, as well as the
        orbit of the other moons, exerting a conflicting gravitational force on
        Io . Io is virtually an electric generator, with a sky full of
        lightning, producing over 400,000 volts. It virtually disrupts the
        magnetic field on Jupiter, further exciting electrons and other ions,
        changing the observable radio signal, heightening it. This lightning sky
        makes it easy to observe, and a great gateway into the world of radio
        astronomy, and a great tool to understand magnetism as a whole. However,
        Jupiter can have observable radio emission from non-io events, because
        particles are still accelerated along magnetic field lines, regardless
        of the presence of Io. However, Jupiter’s relationship with Io and their
        locations in their respective orbits play a large role in detectable
        radio signals.
