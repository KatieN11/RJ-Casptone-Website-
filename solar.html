      <p>
        This is a worldwide radio jove campaing of citizen science to research
        any possible radio emission changes due to the total solar eclipse,
        which happened on April 8th across the Americas. As someone in the
        narrow beam of total elcipse, located in Ohio, I decided to join their
        citizen science campaign to study any possible effects on radio
        emission.

      <h3 class="title">Preparation</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        to prepare, Radio Jove members had a number of observing practice
        sessions, which included observations and zoom meetings. Additionally,
        to prepare we had to take out the phasing cable of our dipoles (so that
        they were pointed at the zenith), and take multiple data points before
        and after the eclipse to compare to eclipse data. the data is in the
        table below.

      <h3>Observations</h3>
      <br>
      <p class="paragraph">
        1. Solar Flare noticed at the bottom of the eclipse during totality - wondering how that could impact solar readings from the telescope</p>
        <p class="paragraph">2. noticeable temperature drops</p>
        <p class="paragraph">3. light level between 99% coverage and 100% coverage wildly different</p>
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        4. the vertical bands from right around the time of totality are strange. It does not look like solar. Could it be RFI or Ionosphere? If its RFI, why now, why during totality? Why would there be similar bands on the graph from SC at the same time if the eclipse passed them first? It could be radio overload, why and how? See analysis and possible reasons for this down below. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Analysis</h3>
      <br>
      <p class="paragraph">
        A possible reason for this strange interference during Eclipse totality is ionospheric interference. According to NASA, totality could cause ionospheric anomalies and a different distribution in electrons, which can cause discrepancies and issues with radio wave propagation cuasing signal fading, absorption, and refraction. However, many of these reasons would cause weaker signals, not stronger. So why is this correlated with totality? Another possible cause is general stations or interference coming from power lines, satellites, or electrical equipment. My question then is, why on intervals, why am specific times? Is it galactic background hump? Why are the signals mirrored below 18 mHZ, if its an overload, overloaded with what? Stations? This is science, every 'answer','hypothesis', or research just leads to more unknowns and more questions.
