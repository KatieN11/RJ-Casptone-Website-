      <p class="paragraph">
        I have had many limitations throughout this process. One limitation I
        have had since the beginning of this project was being sure about the
        processes. I have had to teach myself the data collection software,
        learned how to read the predictability charts, and have had to guess
        many times when it comes to nuances or fine print that no one would
        usually think of specifying, that could play a large role. For instance,
        pressing start before the schedule file runs, or trusting that it will
        do it itself. I have also had to troubleshoot many things, including the
        conductivity of my antenna and how that changes with prolonged exposure
        to the elements. With a radio telescope being an electrical machine,
        things are also prone to break. I have had to replace my receiver, and
        teach myself the new software that came along with it. I have used a
        raspberry pi, radio skypipe, and RSS to try and collect data, and each
        software has come with a host of learning curves and, of course,
        problems. Other mistakes include little errors that proved larger due to
        the remote location of my telescope and how hard it is to get out there
        – If my charger is not turned on correctly, then there goes another
        possible data point and the next time there could be another is in 10
        days…oops. As I continued to troubleshoot, I also ran into issues
        surrounding the time of Jupiter being in the beam of my antenna
        continuously moving earlier into the day, in which it is blocked by the
        more intense noise of the sun. I also think my original hypothesis was
        not as well thought out as it could have been, and that the purpose of
        doing this final research has morphed into something else, which alright
        in technicality and honestly the purpose of research, but it still
        leaves a feeling of purposelessness within the project.
