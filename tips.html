        There were many limitations during this project. From broken receivers,
        F-connectors that could not seem to stay on, and nuances in software
        usage that ended up causing major issues caused much stress, anxiety,
        and many missed opportunities. Nuances and seemingly small questions
        with no answers led to inhibited succcess. Thus, here is my list of tips
        and tricks to have a successful and foolproof setup.

        1. Do not overcomplicate things. You do not need to know how a car works
        to drive it. The same applies to amateur radio astronomy. Sure, having
        general knowledge on how antennas, amplifiers, spectrograms, and
        receivers work, a detailed and complete understanding is not necessary.
        There is always someone who can help answer clarifying questions, and
        trying to know everything at once can way complicate something. Only
        using the parts of the software you need, not necessarily knowing every
        single button or tab, can significantly increase your rate of overall
        success. Make sure you have a good background, but do not overcomplicate
        something and have it scare you off. Understanding beam, gain, and
        declination can help you, but utilizing the software, an in depth
        understanding is not necessary for this process.

        2. Conductivity testing. The manual lists several ways to tell from a
        chart the conductivity of a dipole antenna to a receiver, but you can
        make a simple conductivity tester to be sure. Mine was a metal pole with
        another copper wire that could be connected to a multimeter to test the
        conductivity of both the inside and the outside of the coaxial cable
        leading from each dipole to the receiver. This conductivity tester takes
        less than 5 minutes to make, and it integral for isolating potential
        disconnects somewhere in the antenna setup (be it the connections
        between the antenna and the phasing cable, the cable and the coupler, or
        into the receiver), which can significantly reduce time taken to redo
        these connections. This way you can be sure your setup is working.

        3. Chart out dates you would like to measure in advance, depending on
        your setup. In the case of my setup in particular, it was far, and
        extremely hard to get to, with no source of power whatsoever. This made
        running it for 24 hour periods impossible. Using RJP to look at when
        Jupiter would be in a beam and the overall probability, taking into
        account possible interference from the sun, to find the best times with
        the most probability to plug in the setup. HOWEVER I will append
        something onto this tip, which is, if you are having a lot of trouble,
        like I was, it could be easier to run for long periods of time and try
        to sift through longer files to find what you are looking for.

        4. Familiarize yourself with the nuances of the software. Make a list of
        steps to ensure you set it up correctly. There have been multiple
        instances during my project where a chart did not run because the timed
        observation was not set up correctly. Make a list of what you need to do
        every time to ensure success.

        5. Setup: make sure, especially if your site is hard to get to, you have
        a weatherproof box to keep a computer, chargers, receiver, amplifier,
        etc, in. I attached mine to a big board inside the box, so they would
        not slide around.

        6. Using crimp F-Connectors. One of the main difficulties I had in the
        constructing process was F connectors continuously falling off. The
        screw on F - Connectors that come with the kit work fine, but if you are
        anything like me, that is way out of your league. Using crimp on
        connectors makes it so much easier to adjust, and put on the
        F-Connectors, mainly so they do not fall off, forcing you to put them on
        again.

        7. Join the Radio Jove Group on Groups.io â†’ they can answer any
        questions one may have. They also post their charts frequently on the
        email chain, so one could compare their own with the ones sent to make
        sure they are correctly interpreting signals from the sun or jupiter.

      <p class="paragraph">
        1. Make it your own! Add something of your own to the project. For
        example, at the beginning I used a Raspberry Pi and an amplifier to
        record audio recordings, not spectrograms, so I could try to hear the
        sounds as sounds. It alows you to not only hear Jupiter or the Sun, and
        to be able to identify S and L bursts, but also do listen to sweepers
        [which are used by scientists to see the refelctivity of the
        ionosphere], which sound super cool.
