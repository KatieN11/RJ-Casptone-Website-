        From my research, it is evident that there is, indeed, a pattern to when
        Io producing Jovian storms happen. Much like what was said in the
        alternative hypothesis, the rotation of Jupiter’s magnetic field as it
        compares to the rotation of the planet and its moons produces specific
        phenomena that lend themselves to strong radio waves. However, the
        pattern is predicted to be a near constant radio emission (see
        background research), since Jupiter and Io are constantly interacting
        with one another, and the gravitational pull of Jupiter in constantly
        being juxtaposed with the pull of other moons (specifically Europa and
        Ganymede, both galilean moons). This creates a gravitational tug-of-war,
        and leads to the expulsion of electrons and ions from Io’s volcanic
        surface into Juptier’s magnetosphere. These electrons are then launched
        at high speeds, generating radio emission detectable from Earth. Hence,
        the location of the other moons relative to Jupiter does indeed matter
        in the strength of these radio waves, as there are specific points
        within Jupiter, Io’s, and Europa’s orbit where these storms, and radio
        emission, are strongest. Io, much like many other moons, has an
        elliptical orbit around Jupiter and is also tidally locked, meaning the
        same side of the moon is always facing the planet. This orbit puts Io at
        varying distances from Jupiter, and from the other moons, which allows
        its surface to bulge up 330 feet, and contributes to the volcanic
        activity that ends up in the strong radio emission, since its orbit
        happens to pass through Jupiter’s magnetic field, upsetting the field on
        its way around, and heling produce even stronger radio signals from even
        stronger storms. But, strongest storm does not necessarily mean
        detectable. The question of ‘what are the patterns in Jovian Io storms
        and radio emission’ turns out to be less a question about the nature of
        Jupiter’s magnetic field and radio emission from the swirling electrons
        on volcanic io, but more about the conditions of the observer. Thus, my
        attention shifted to studying my own location relative to the location
        of Jupiter, which was proven a difficult task, as spring nears.

        One of my main conclusions is: Io storms are hard to see. Very hard to
        see. Whether or not Jovian radio emissions are detectable by a radio
        telescope depends on a multitude of things. 1: the beam of the antenna,
        meaning, which hours of the day radio emissions from Jupiter can be
        picked up by the antenna, which, most likely, is a less than preferable
        amount of time. 2, the prevalence of radio interference, or RFI, that
        would just cover a signal. As spring nears, Jupiter and the Sun are in
        the beam of the dual dipole during the same time frame, and the
        ionosphere, stronger during the day, can refract emissions, making it
        very hard to see any Jovian radio signals, simply because it could be
        covered by the much stronger emissions coming from the sun or refracted
        by the E layer of Earth’s ionosphere. Just because an Io storm is not
        detectable by an actual antenna, due to RFI or beamwidth, does not mean
        it is not happening or emitting radio waves that would otherwise be
        detectable. This is where the table from Radio Jupiter Pro comes in
        handy. This software not only shows when Jupiter (either Io related
        emission or non-Io emission) is detectable and in beam of a specific
        antenna setup (depending on latitude, longitude, phasing, dipole height,
        etc), but also the probability of detectable radio emission from Io
        storms in a location, throughout the day, regardless if it is
        necessarily in the beam of a specific telescope. The thing is, trying to
        analyze these patterns in the context of the rotation of Jupiter, Io,
        and other Galilean moons relative to Earth and to one another is
        extremely difficult to do from an ordinary dual dipole antenna setup. In
        order to capture every Jovian emission (which are near constant), not
        only would the orbits have to line up, but it would have to be during a
        time of low interference from devices, other people, the sun, the
        refraction of the E layer of the ionosphere, etc. This makes detecting
        Jupiter the easiest to do at night, when the sun and the ionosphere are
        weaker, and the signals can actually be picked up. However, Jupiter and
        its orbit do not work on the same schedule as the Earth’s, and in the
        winter and spring, Jupiter is in a beam in the afternoon, when the
        ionosphere is stronger and the sun could be emitting. Therefore, the
        best time to look at these patterns is in the late summer or fall, when,
        especially for me in the midwest, Jupiter is in beam during the night,
        and when other interference is more sparse. So, for much of this
        process, I relied on the accurate predictive software of Radio Jupiter
        Pro to help analyze Jupiter’s relation to the Earth during these
        periods.

        Looking from the RJP data, the observable Jovian storms (as predicted by
        RJP, not by the beam of my actual and specific dual dipole setup),
        Io-storms are highly detectable within certain spots that correlate in
        both the Earth’s and Jupiter’s orbits. These locations are known as
        Io-A, Io-B, and Io-C. Because it has been previously established that
        io-Jupiter interaction is near constant, the detectability of these
        storms relies heavily on the Earth, and its location relative to
        Jupiter. The software was made by studying the rate of the Earth
        rotation compared to that of Jupiters, and three locations that are the
        most detectable via the Earth, and also the strongest storms–Just
        because Jupiter has a near constant emissions does not mean that the
        storms are always of the same magnitude, this again depends on the
        activity of other moons, especially galilean moons. From the tables on
        RJP, I found that, on average, the high detectable Io-Storms in February
        lasted a little under two hours, 1.71 Hours to be exact, which I found
        from taking averages on the table from the month of February. Io-A was
        also the most prominent location in terms of storms, with 44% of
        predicted Io-Storms being at this location, followed by 395 at Io-B and
        only 17% at Io-C. Io-A and Io-C are located right next to each other on
        the RJP predictability charts, meaning that Io-C readings usually follow
        directly after an Io-A storm, meaning that their locations within the
        orbits and comparative declinations are fairly similar and close to one
        another (hence a constant emission, constant storm). However, out of all
        the storms predicted to take place in February, only 50% of Io-A storms
        and 43% of Io-B storms could have the chance of being read by my dual
        dipole setup. These percentages do not account for RFI or solar
        interference. 100% of Io-C storms were going to be in beam of my dipole,
        at least the super high probability ones, but again, Io-C storms usually
        tend to have less probability on RJP overall, and are therefore are less
        likely to be seen and harder to pick up (mostly because there is a
        greater chance it may not even happen).

        From my telescope data on February 1st, it is evident that the spring
        approaching does make these Io storms harder to measure, as the RJP
        software predicted both Io A and Io C during this time, but as seen from
        the RSS chart of my (working) Antenna, weak Jovian signs are covered by
        RFI and possibly solar, which does not mean the Jovian emission is not
        there, just harder to measure. It is also clear from the concentration
        of the data found on the archive. Most data that could be found for
        Jupiter were from December or January of this year, despite having the
        entire archive updated often. This is because Jupiter is harder to
        detect when masked by stronger signals coming from elsewhere.

        Overall, my hypothesis was correct in the idea that Jupiter does emit
        radio waves in varying strength depending on the rotation of Jupiter
        relative to Io, and the other Galilean moons. However, this evidence was
        mostly collected through background research and prior information
        rather than straight telescope data, which ended up provide me with more
        insight into radio telescopes in general, and juxtaposing RFI, Solar,
        and Jupiter, and the relationship between the Earth, the Sun, and
        Jupiter, and how that relationship changes over time, hence the readings
        becoming a lot more difficult to measure as the Sun begins to conflict
        with Jupiter’s time above the horizon. What I have learned from this
        project of studying and analyzing Jovian signals were not only things
        about the nature of Io emission that is detectable and predictable from
        a telescope and RJP software, but also the inhibiting (and other
        interesting) parts of the universe that work in tandem with Jupiter,
        sometimes blocking it out, sometimes not. The truth of the matter is,
        that the Universe does not pause so one can collect the data they want
        or answer the question they want. But this is what science is, an ever
        open rabbit hole of new things that are unexpected, some of them more
        useful than others, like the interference of human RFI that is
        relatively self explanatory versus the differences in shielding of
        interstellar radio signals from Earths’ ionosphere that are stronger
        during the day. Even if the data one receives is not necessarily the
        data one sought out to receive, it does not mean it does not show you or
        teach you anything or that a viable conclusion is not applicable from
        said data. I am happy to have RJP to look and study potential patterns,
        but like I said, I think the real conclusion comes from not necessarily
        the essential questions, (which was answered as near constant emission),
        but the subsequent questions. Questions about the ionosphere, about
        solar radiation, about detectability, about the nuts and bolts of
        antenna building, about magnetic fields and electronics, and about the
        universe as a whole. So yes, there is a pattern to Io storms. They are
        constant. Stronger in some places, sure, but constant. But, what is
        interesting is what blocked that data. The galactic hump is present on
        one of my RSP graphs, the sheer amount of interference that sometimes
        seems like it coming from nowhere, and learning about patterns as a
        result of detectability and the intersection of many different things.
        So, if the question was, Is there a pattern in the detectability of
        Jovian Io storms by my radio telescope? The answer to that would also be
        yes. Yes, but not in the same way that the actual storms happening on Io
        exhibit a pattern. Yes in the fact that there are many factors: The
        Ionosphere, the Sun, the Weather, The time of day, The time of year, the
        declination of Sun and Jupiter, the Location, the Beam, that can follow
        patterns throughout the years and days and impact the detectability of a
        near constant, sometimes fluctuating source of radio emission.
